# Taxi_Rank_Project
# Clustering Geolocation Data in Python using DBSCAN and K-Means

Project Scope: We will be using Taxi dataset downloaded from Kaggle and perform clustering Geolocation Data using K-Means and demonstrate how to use DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) which discovers clusters of different shapes and sizes from data containing noise and outliers and HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) which performs DBSCAN over varying epsilon values and integrates the result to find a clustering that gives the best stability over epsilon. With Key clusters of these taxis, we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.
